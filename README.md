## 📄 Abstract

Breast cancer is one of the leading causes of death among women globally. Early and accurate diagnosis plays a vital role in improving survival rates.  
In this research, we implemented and compared multiple machine learning models on the **Wisconsin Breast Cancer Diagnostic (WBCD) dataset** to classify tumors as **benign** or **malignant**.  
Our experiments demonstrate that the proposed models achieve **high accuracy** and can assist healthcare professionals in making better clinical decisions.

## 📊 Dataset

- **Dataset:** Wisconsin Breast Cancer Diagnostic Dataset  
- **Source:** [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)  
- **Features:** 30 numerical features (15 selected for modeling)  
- **Target:** Diagnosis → M (malignant), B (benign)

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models Used

The following models were implemented and evaluated as described in the research paper:

- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Naïve Bayes (NB)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest (RF)
- XGBoost (XGB)
- Voting Classifier (RF + XGB)
- Stacking (RF + XGB + Logistic Regression)

We applied **data preprocessing, feature scaling, hyperparameter tuning, and cross-validation** for robust model evaluation.
